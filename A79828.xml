            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> and the other three; There is publiſhed a Book under <hi>Mr. Walwins</hi> Name, wherein he manifeſteth a great deſire, that <hi>the Parliament had been pleaſed for the ſatisfaction of all thoſe their faithfull Friends who are concerned in it, and of the whole Nation in generall, to have expreſly applyed each part of the Book to each cenſure upon it, as to have ſhewed in what part it was falſe, ſcandalous, and reproachfull, in what deſtructive to the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, alſo to have ſhewed what part, ſentence, or matter therein rended to diviſion and mutiny in the Army, and the rayſing of a new Warre in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; or wherein to hinder the reliefe of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and continuing of Free-Quarter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what end he writes thus, it may eaſily be conjectur'd: And therefore to wipe of the aſperſion and reproach from your <hi>Honourable Houſe,</hi> we have undertaken the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of your <hi>Cenſure</hi> upon that <hi>Booke</hi> and according to the ſevereſt crimes and guilt Expreſſed in your <hi>Act,</hi> have here manifeſted the ſayd Booke to deſerve no leſſe in every particular.</p>
            <p>Now from this anſwer, we are occaſioned to put you in minde, how dangerous and deſtructive to all formes and

            <p>It is true, in our Lawes there are helps provided: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the miſcheif and miſerie remaines. And why? As fooliſh Birds frighted a little at firſt with the Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>Scarerow,</hi> and after a while obſerving that it ſtirre not, are bold to ſit it upon it and defile it. So when Authority either revives ſome former ſtatute or makes a new act againſt the aſperſers of the preſent Government, at firſt the <hi>Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> and <hi>Raylers</hi> are a little frighted: But ſeeing there is not that mooving, acting, proſecuting as they fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, It is very remarkeable, that were the things true as they relate (which are not) yet would they not prove their aſperſions; which ſhews though they wanted matter, yet not mallice, from
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:117524:43"/> their accuſations they thus conclude.</p>

               <hi>And ſo vaniſht away all their glorious flattery of the King and his partie, and their notorious diſſimulation appeared, abuſing thereby the faith of the Army, and making it cleare to all diſcerning men, that ſuch as could breake with one ſort of men will make no conſcience of keeping faith with another,</hi> And a little after, <hi>by all which tis evident that according to the Maximes of politians they Judge themſelves looſe where other men are bound: and all obligations are to them tranſitorie and ceremoniall, and that indeed every thing is good and juſt onely as it is conducing to their corrupt and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intereſts</hi>

            <p>For their proof, we ſhal preſently examine it, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the way take notice that it is not poſſible for men to be worſe or viler then the <hi>Officers</hi> are here ſet forth: for if they <hi>make no conſcience of keeping faith with any,</hi> they are not fit for Church or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: much leſſe to be<note n="g" place="margin">They ſerve the <hi>Officers,</hi> as the Prieſts did the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
